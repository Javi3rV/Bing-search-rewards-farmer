# Bing-search-rewards-farmer
Batch file that searches random things to farm search rewards


## How to use
Close all Edge windows, then run the .bat file.
It will ask you for your rewards Level, since lvl-2 gives 30 searches with rewards and lvl-1 is 10.
When finished, it will open a configuration tab to delete history (to delete all this random searches).
Do not touch anything while it's working, it will do everything automatically.


## It doesn't farm all the points
That's a problem to solve, but you can just re-run the script with level 1 to get the rest of the points.
